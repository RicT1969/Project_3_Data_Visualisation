# New Zealand Earthquake Visualisation

An interactive web-based map to visualize earthquake data in New Zealand collected by the GeoNet, highlighting the risk between occurence.

## Background
An application has been developed with the purpose of visualizing earthquake data from the past 365 days in New Zealand. The data utilized for this application was sourced from Geonet, an initiative established in 2001 to construct and operate a contemporary geological hazard monitoring system in New Zealand. Geonet effectively tracks and records approximately 20,000 earthquakes annually within and surrounding the nation, of which the majority are of small magnitude, while approximately 250 events are significant enough to be perceptible. To access earthquake statistics for the New Zealand region based on observations since 1960, the Earthquake Statistics page is available, while the GeoNet Quake Statistics page provides information on earthquake occurrences within the past year. 
The primary objective behind developing this application is to provide a straightforward and expeditious visualization of recent seismic activity in various locations, thereby facilitating public comprehension of the associated risks and frequency of such events.

## Features

- Leaflet-based interactive map.
- Visualization of earthquake data.
- Graphing a bar chart displays Quakes by Magnitude and locality.
- Summary table adjusted by map context.
